👋 Hi there, I'm Josh 🧔🏻! I live in beautiful [Camarillo](https://www.ci.camarillo.ca.us/Visitors/Discover%20Camarillo.pdf), California 🌅 with my wife Whitnie 👸🏼 and my husky-mix Maya 🐕 (she's the favicon!).

I'm a Senior Consultant for a technology consultancy company on their End User Computing ([EUC](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/end-user-computing)) team. I really enjoy the challenge of problem solving and love being able to learn new things. Aside from working with some pretty awesome co-workers, I work with cool [remote work](https://www.citrix.com) and [cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com) technologies!

I graduated from California State University, Northridge [(CSUN)](https://www.csun.edu) with a B.S. in [Business Management](https://catalog.csun.edu/academics/mgt/programs/bs-business-administration-ix/management) and an [Information Systems Minor](https://catalog.csun.edu/academics/som/programs/minor-information-systems). During that time, I worked part time selling computers at the [Buy More](https://chuck-nbc.fandom.com/wiki/Buy_More) 😎. Realizing I'd rather be working with technology and not just selling it, I found a new job as a consultant.

The experience I gained working with enterprise technologies, led me to a full time help desk role after graduation. Always wanting to learn new things and not being afraid to take on new responsibilities, I ended up as Systems Engineer before looking to return to consulting. I missed using my knowledge and experience to help clients and have been happily doing that since.

### Doing IT the Lazy Way

I've always enjoyed sharing knowledge and discussing my interests and felt a blog would be a great way to connect with and give back to others and the community. I don't expect to cover anything new or groundbreaking, but hopefully you'll find my posts useful if not at least interesting. I'm always open to ideas and feedback - good or bad.

The blog itself is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). No databases to maintain or security patches to install! Plus it gives me a reason to use the terminal and `git`.

Oh, yeah! I'm not actually lazy, although procrastination is real. It's just a more interesting slogan than "Doing IT the *Efficient* Way". When doing IT related work, if there's a chance I could need to do something more than once, I'll attempt to automate it. I'm really big on consistency and reproducibility and feel that the time invested up front pays off later. Plus it helps with documentation-And we all could be better at that, right?
